# CompTIA A+ Notes (Professor Messer)

This repository contains my personal study notes for the **CompTIA A+ certification**, based on [Professor Messer's YouTube channel](https://www.professormesser.com/).  
All notes were written in **Obsidian**, so the structure makes use of Markdown, internal links, and graph view references.

## 📚 Content

- Complete topic coverage aligned with CompTIA A+ exam objectives
- Structured notes with headings, subheadings, and internal links
- Summaries of key concepts explained by Professor Messer
- Quick reference material for revision

## 🛠 Tools & Workflow

- **Obsidian** → for note-taking and graph-based knowledge management

They are **personal study notes** created while watching Professor Messer’s free YouTube lectures.
