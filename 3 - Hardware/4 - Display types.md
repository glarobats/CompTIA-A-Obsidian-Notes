## Display Technologies Overview
### LCD (Liquid Crystal Display)
- Operation: Light passes through liquid crystals, modulated to form images.
- Advantages: Lightweight, low power consumption, affordable.
- Disadvantages: Poor black levels, needs separate backlight (fluorescent or LED), difficult light replacement.
---
### LCD Panel Types
- TN (Twisted Nematic):
    - Oldest tech, fast response (gaming use).
    - Weak viewing angles, color distortion.
- IPS (In-Plane Switching):
    - Excellent color accuracy and viewing angles.
    - Higher production cost, slightly slower response.
- VA (Vertical Alignment):
    - Middle ground between TN and IPS.
    - Good colors and contrast, slower response times.

### OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode)
- Operation: Organic compounds emit light under electric current â€” no backlight needed.
- Advantages: Thinner, lighter, flexible (no glass), superior contrast and color accuracy.
- Use cases: Phones, tablets, smartwatches.
- Disadvantages: Higher cost, potential burn-in issues (not mentioned, but worth noting).
---
### Mini LED
- Backlight: Same as LED LCD but uses smaller, more numerous LEDs.
- Advantages:
    - Per-LED dimming for better control.
    - Deeper blacks, improved HDR and color precision.
- Position: Step between traditional LCD and OLED.
---
### Touchscreen Displays
- Concept: Combines display and input in one interface.
- Types: Capacitive, resistive, infrared, etc.
- Use: Tablets, laptops, hybrid devices.
- Pros: Direct input, no keyboard needed.
- Cons: Finger smudges, limited precision (unless stylus used).
---
### Digitizer
- Purpose: Detects pen/stylus input precisely.
- Use: Tablets, 2-in-1 laptops, drawing devices.
- Advantage: Ideal for handwriting, drawing, CAD-style input.
---
### Backlight & Inverter
- Backlight: Provides illumination (fluorescent or LED).
- Inverter: Converts DC to AC for fluorescent lamps.
- Diagnostics:
    - Check for faint image using flashlight.
    - Replace inverter or full display if necessary.
