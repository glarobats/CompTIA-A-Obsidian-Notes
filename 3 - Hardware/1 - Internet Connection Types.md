## Satellite networking
### Communication to a satellites
- Non - terrestrial communication
### High cost relative to terrestrial networking
- 100 Mbit/s down, 5Mbit/s down are common.
- Remote sites, difficult-to-network sites.
### Relatively high latency
- Some systems have 250ms up, 250ms down.
- Starlink advertises 25 to 60ms.
### Not always a perfect option
- Line of sight, rain fade.

## Fiber 
### High speed data communication
- Frequencies of light.
### Higher installation cost than copper
- Equipment is more costly.
- More difficult to repair.
- Communicate over long distances.
### Large installation in the WAN core
- Supports very high data rates.
- SONET, wavelength division multiplexing.
### Fiber has appears at the premises
- Business and home use.

## Cable
### Broadband
- Transmission across multiple frequencies.
- Different traffic types.
### Data on the cable network
- DOCSIS, (Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification).
### High speed networking
- 50Mbits/s through 1000+Mbits/s are common.
### Multiple services
- Data, voice, video.
---
## DSL
### ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)
- Uses telephone lines.
### Download speed is faster than the upload speed (asymmetric)
- 200Mbits/s downstream / 20Mbits/s upstream are common.
- 3km limitation from the central office.
- Faster speeds may be possible if closer to the CO.
