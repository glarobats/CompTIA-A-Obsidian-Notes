## Satellite Networking

### Communication to Satellites

- Non-terrestrial communication link between ground stations and satellites.
    
### High Cost Relative to Terrestrial Networking

- Typical speeds: 100 Mbit/s down, 5 Mbit/s up.
- Common for remote or hard-to-reach areas.
    
### High Latency

- GEO systems: ~250 ms up + ~250 ms down.
- LEO systems (e.g. Starlink): ~25–60 ms.
    
### Limitations

- Requires clear line of sight.
- Affected by weather (rain fade).

## Fiber

### High-Speed Data Communication

- Uses light frequencies transmitted through glass or plastic fibers.
    
### High Installation and Maintenance Cost

- Equipment is more expensive and harder to repair.
- Excellent for long-distance, high-bandwidth connections.
    
### WAN Core Usage

- Backbone of modern networks (SONET, WDM).
    
### Increasing Availability

- Fiber-to-the-Premises (FTTP) for homes and businesses.

## Cable

### Broadband Technology

- Transmits data using multiple frequencies over coaxial cable.
    
### DOCSIS Standard

- Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification enables IP networking over TV infrastructure.
    
### High-Speed Access

- Typical speeds: 50 Mbit/s to 1 Gbit/s+.
    
### Multiple Services

- Supports internet, TV, and voice over the same connection.

## DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)

### ADSL (Asymmetric DSL)

- Uses existing telephone lines for internet access.
    
### Asymmetric Speeds

- Common speeds: up to 200 Mbit/s down / 20 Mbit/s up.
- Speed decreases with distance — limited to ~3 km from the central office (CO).
- Higher speeds closer to CO.

## Cellular Networks

### Mobile Connectivity

- Used by smartphones and mobile devices.
    
### Cellular Architecture

- Coverage divided into cells, each served by a base station using assigned frequencies.
    
### Tethering

- Share mobile data by turning a phone into a Wi-Fi hotspot.
    
### Mobile Hotspots

- Dedicated devices that provide internet access via cellular data.

## WISP (Wireless Internet Service Provider)

### Terrestrial Wireless Access

- Provides internet over radio links instead of cables.
    
### Rural and Remote Coverage

- Common in areas lacking wired infrastructure.

### Technologies Used

- Mesh 802.11, 5G home internet, proprietary radio systems.
    
### Requirements

- Typically needs an outdoor antenna.
- Speeds range from 10 Mbit/s to over 1 Gbit/s depending on setup.
