## LAN

### Local Area Network

- “Local” is relative — typically within a **single building or campus**.
- Provides **high-speed, low-latency** connectivity.
- Uses **Ethernet** or **IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi)** standards.
- If it’s not fast, it’s not local.

## WAN

### Wide Area Network

- Connects **LANs across long distances**, often spanning **countries or continents**.
- **Much slower** than LANs due to transmission distance and complexity.
- Uses diverse technologies: **Point-to-Point links**, **MPLS**, **satellite**, and other **terrestrial/non-terrestrial** systems.
- Backbone of global internet connectivity.

## MAN

### Metropolitan Area Network

- Covers a **city or large campus area** — larger than a LAN, smaller than a WAN.
- Commonly based on **Metro-Ethernet** or **fiber rings**.
- Often **operated or regulated by local governments** with access to public infrastructure rights-of-way.

## WLAN

### Wireless Local Area Network

- Implements **Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11)** technologies for wireless LAN access.
- Enables **mobility within limited areas** like offices, campuses, or public zones.
- Coverage can be **extended with multiple access points** across buildings or open spaces.

## PAN

### Personal Area Network

- A **short-range network** centered around a single user.
- Uses technologies like **Bluetooth**, **Infrared (IR)**, and **NFC**.
- Typical use cases:
    - **Mobile phone ↔ headset** connection.
    - **Vehicle integration** for audio and navigation.
    - **Wearables** collecting workout or health telemetry.

## SAN

### Storage Area Network

- Dedicated high-speed network for **block-level data storage access**.
- Appears to the OS as **local disks**, despite being remote.
- Delivers **high throughput and low latency**, essential for enterprise databases and virtualized environments.
- Often isolated and built with **Fiber Channel or iSCSI** for maximum bandwidth.
