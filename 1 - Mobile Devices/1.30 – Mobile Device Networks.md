## Mobile Device Networks

#### Cellular networks 
1. Mobile devices
	- "Cell" phones
2. Separate land into "cells"
	- Antenna coverages a cell with certain frequencies
3. Enable or disable voice and/or data
	- Airplane mode disables all cellular networks
	- Could also disable data data but keep voice
---
#### 3G technology
1. 3rd generation
	- introduced in 1998
2. Upgraded data connectivity
	- Incremental 3G updates improved speed
	- Usually several megabits per second
3. Bandwidth improvement allowed new functionality
	- GPS
	- Mobile television
	- Video on demand
	- Video conferencing
---
#### 4G and LTE
1. Long Term Evolution (LTE)
	- A "4G" technology
	- Based on GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) and EDGE (Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution)
	- Standards support download rates of 150Mbit/s
2. LTE Advanced (LTE-A)
	- Standard supports download rates of 3000 Mbit/s
---
#### 5G
1. Fifth generation cellular networking
	- Launched worldwide in 2020
2. Significant performance improvements
	- At higher frequencies
	- Eventually 10 gigabits per second
	- Slower speeds from 100-900 Mbit/s
3. Significant IoT impact 
	- Bandwidth becomes less of a constraint 
	- Larger data transfers
	- Faster monitoring and notification
	- Additional cloud processing

#### [[1.10 - Laptop Hardware#802.11 Wireless and Bluetooth|WiFi]]
1. Connect to a local 802.11 network
	- Data access for email and Internet
	- Higher speeds, no cellular bandwidth use
2. Requires a local access point
	- Limited distance coverage
3. May also support voice communication
	- [[1.10 - Laptop Hardware#802.11 Wireless and Bluetooth|WiFi]] calling
	- Requires support from the voice carrier
	- Very useful when cellular coverage may not be available

#### [[1.20 - Connecting Mobile Devices#Hotspot / Tethering|Hotspot]]
1. Turn your phone into a  [[1.10 - Laptop Hardware#802.11 Wireless and Bluetooth|WiFi]] [[1.20 - Connecting Mobile Devices#Hotspot / Tethering|Hotspot]]
	- Your own personal wireless router 
	- Extend the cellular data network to all of your devices
2. Dependent of phone type and provider
	- May require additional charges and data costs
---
#### Subscriber Identity Module (SIM)
1. A unique identifier for cellular devices 
	- Often a tiny physical card
	- Replace the SIM and the phone has a new number
2. Contains information for the carrier and user
	- SIM ID and phone number
	- Cellular network information
	- Storage space for contacts, messages, etc.
	- Specialized tool needed for it to be removed or inserted
3. eSIM - embedded SIM
	- SIM is inside the device
	- Cannot be physically removed
4. Many devices support multiple SIMs

#### [[1.20 - Connecting Mobile Devices#1.10 - Laptop Hardware 802.11 Wireless and Bluetooth Bluetooth|Bluetooth]] pairing
1. Connect a Bluetooth device
	- Built-in security 
	- Use or verify a PIN
2. Pair the devices one time
	- Future connections should be automatic

3. Select discovered device 
	- Many devices may appear!
4. Enter or confirm PIN 
	- Should be the same on both devices 
5. Test connectivity 
	- Devices should now communicate 
	- Test can be done by powering down, powering back up device and making sure it can automatically reconnect over the [[1.20 - Connecting Mobile Devices#1.10 - Laptop Hardware 802.11 Wireless and Bluetooth Bluetooth|Bluetooth]] connection
