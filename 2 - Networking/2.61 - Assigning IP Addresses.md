## Networking with IPv4

### IP address, e.g. `192.168.1.165`

- Every device on a network must have a **unique** IP address.
    
### Subnet mask, e.g. `255.255.255.0`

- Used by a device to determine which IPs are on the **same subnet**.
- The subnet mask itself isn’t transmitted in normal traffic.
- Commonly asked in network setup: _“What is the subnet mask?”_
    
### Default gateway

- The router that forwards traffic **outside your local subnet**.
- Must be **within** the local subnet range (e.g. `192.168.1.1` for `192.168.1.0/24`).

## Static IP Addressing

### Fixed IP address (doesn’t change automatically)

- Manually configured on each device.
- If network settings change, you must update it manually.
- Doesn’t scale well for large environments.
    
### Use case

- Servers, printers, or devices that need a **consistent** IP.
    
### Alternative

- Use **DHCP reservations** instead of full manual configuration.

## Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)

### IPv4 link-local range

- Used when a device can’t contact a DHCP server.
- Range: `169.254.0.0` – `169.254.255.255`
    - Usable block: `169.254.1.0` – `169.254.254.255`
    - First and last /16 blocks are reserved.
        
### Behavior

- The OS randomly selects an address in the block.
- Uses ARP to check for conflicts.
- Not routable — only for local (same link) communication.

## Turning Dynamic into Static

### Dynamic (DHCP)

- DHCP server assigns the first available IP from its pool.
- IPs may change when the lease expires or the device reconnects.
    
### Making it static

1. **Manual configuration** — turn off DHCP on the device and enter IP, mask, gateway, DNS manually.
    - Not scalable.
2. **Better method: DHCP reservation**
    - Configure the DHCP server to always assign the same IP to a specific MAC address.
