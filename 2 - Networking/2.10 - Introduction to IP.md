## Introduction to IP
#### A series of moving vans
1. Efficiently move large amounts of data
	- Use a shipping truck
2. The network topology is the road
	- Ethernet, DSL, cable system
3. The truck is the Internet Protocol (IP)
	- We've designed the roads for this truck
4. The boxes hold your data
	- Boxes of TCP and UDP
5. Inside the boxes are more things
	- Application information
---
#### IP - Internet Protocol

- Information is nested, in the world of networking it's called encapsulation and decapsulation.
- Information sent from a client to a server via an ethernet cable is shown below.
- All the information is located in the Ethernet Payload.
- The Ethernet Header and Ethernet Trailer shows us where the data starts and ends.

![[Ethernet_Header.excalidraw]]

- Within the Ethernet Payload exists the IP Header and the IP Payload which contains IP Traffic

![[IP_Payload.excalidraw]]

- Within the IP Payload exists the TCP Header and the TCP Payload 

![[TCP_Payload.excalidraw]]

- Within the TCP Payload exists HTTP data which holds all server communication

![[HTTP_Payload.excalidraw]]

#### TCP and UDP
1. Transported inside of IP
	- Encapsulated by the IP protocol
2. Two similar ways to transport information
	- Different features for different applications
3. TCP and UDP belong to OSI Layer 4
	- The transport layer
4. Multiplexing 
	- Use many different applications at the same time (sending information simultaneously very different from each other)
	- TCP and UDP
---
#### TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
1. Connection-oriented
	- A formal connection setup and close
2. "Reliable" Delivery
	- Recovery from errors
	- can manage out-of-order messages and retransmissions
	- TCP includes acknowledgment process. The receiver will send an acknowledgment of data being received.
3. Flow control
	- The receiver can manage how much data is sent depending on data received or data loss
---
#### UDP - User Datagram Protocol
1. Connectionless
	- No formal open or close to the connection
2. "Unreliable" delivery
	- No error recovery
	- No reordering of data or transmissions
	- No acknowledgment is being sent by the receiver to the sender
3. No flow control
	- Sender determines the amount of data transmitted
---
#### Why would you ever use UDP?
1. Real time communication
	- There is no way to stop and resend the data
	- Time doesn't stop for your network
	- Very little overhead (no extra data to be sent)
2. Connectionless protocols 
	- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
	- TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
3. The data might not get through
	- The application keeps track and decides what to do (if data must be resent or not)
	- It might not do anything (if application is VoIP)
---
#### Communication using TCP
1. Connection - oriented protocols prefer a return receipt
	- HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
	- SSH (Secure Shell)
2. The application doesn't worry about out of order frames or missing data
	- TCP handles all of the communication overhead
	- The application has one job
--- 
#### Speedy delivery
1. The IP delivery truck delivers from one IP address to another IP address
	- Every house has an address, every computer has an IP address
2. Boxes arrive at the house / IP address
	- Where do the boxes go?
	- Each box has a room name
3. Port is written on the outside of the box 
	- Drop the box into the right room
--- 
#### Lots of ports
1. IPv4 sockets 
	- When information is sent there is usually at least 3 types of information that is important
	- Server IP address, protocol, server application port number
	- Client IP address, protocol, client port number 
2. Non-ephemeral ports - permanent port numbers 
	- Ports 0 through 1023
	- Usually on a server or a service 
3. Ephemeral ports - temporary port numbers
	- Ports 1024 through 65535
	- Determined in real-time by the client
---
#### Port numbers
1. TCP and UDP ports can be any number between 0 and 65535
2. Most servers (services)use non-ephemeral (not-temporary) port numbers
	- This isn't always the case 
	- It's just a number
3. Port numbers are for communication, not security
4. Service port numbers need to be "well known"
5. TCP port numbers aren't the same as UDP port numbers
---
#### Ports on the network
1. Web server - tcp/80
2. VoIP server - udp/5004
3. Email server - tcp/143

Data sent in a packet:

![[HTTP_Payload.excalidraw]]
![[TCP_VoIP.excalidraw]]
![[TCP_EMAIL.excalidraw]]

more detailed:

![[HTTP_Payload.excalidraw 1]]
![[TCP_VoIP.excalidraw_1]]
![[TCP_EMAIL.excalidraw 1]]
