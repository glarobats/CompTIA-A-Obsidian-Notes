## Introduction to IP
#### A series of moving vans
1. Efficiently move large amounts of data
	- Use a shipping truck
2. The network topology is the road
	- Ethernet, DSL, cable system
3. The truck is the Internet Protocol (IP)
	- We've designed the roads for this truck
4. The boxes hold your data
	- Boxes of TCP and UDP
5. Inside the boxes are more things
	- Application information

#### IP - Internet Protocol

Information is nested, in the world of networking it's called encapsulation and decapsulation.
Information sent from a client to a server via an ethernet cable is shown below.
All the information is located in the Ethernet Payload.
The Ethernet Header and Ethernet Trailer shows us where the data starts and ends.

![[Ethernet_Header.excalidraw]]

Within the Ethernet Payload exists the IP Header and the IP Payload which contains IP Traffic

![[IP_Payload.excalidraw]]

Within the IP Payload exists the TCP Header and the TCP Payload 

![[TCP_Payload.excalidraw]]

Within the TCP Payload exists HTTP data which holds all server communication

![[HTTP_Payload.excalidraw]]

#### TCP and UDP
1. Transported inside of IP
	- Encapsulated by the IP protocol
2. Two similar ways to transport information
	- Different features for different applications
3. TCP and UDP belong to OSI Layer 4
	- The transport layer
4. Multiplexing 
	- Use many different applications at the same time (sending information simultaneously very different from each other)
	- TCP and UDP

#### TCP - Transmission Control Protocol
1. Connection-oriented
	- A formal connection setup and close
2. "Reliable" Delivery
	- Recovery from errors
	- can manage out-of-order messages and retransmissions
	- TCP includes acknowledgment process. The receiver will send an acknowledgment of data being received.
3. Flow control
	- The receiver can manage how much data is sent depending on data received or data loss
---
#### UDP - User Datagram Protocol
1. Connectionless
	- No formal open or close to the connection
2. "Unreliable" delivery
	- No error recovery
	- No reordering of data or transmissions
	- No acknowledgment is being sent by the receiver to the sender
3. No flow control
	- Sender determines the amount of data transmitted
---
#### Why would you ever use UDP?
1. Real time communication
	- There is no way to stop and resend the data
	- Time doesn't stop for your network
	- Very little overhead (no extra data to be sent)
2. Connectionless protocols 
	- DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
	- TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)
3. The data might not get through
	- The application keeps track and decides what to do (if data must be resent or not)
	- It might not do anything (if application is VoIP)
