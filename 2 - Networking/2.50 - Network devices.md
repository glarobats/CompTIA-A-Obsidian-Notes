## Routers
- Forwards traffic based on IP addresses.
- Routers inside switches are "Layer 3 switches".
### Often connects diverse network types
- LAN, WAN, copper, fiber.
    

## Switches
### Bridging done in hardware
- ASIC-based forwarding by MAC address.
### Many ports and features
- Core of enterprise networks.
- May provide PoE.
### Multilayer switch
- Adds routing functionality.

## Unmanaged switches
### Few configuration options
- Plug and play.
### Fixed configuration
- No VLANs.
### Limited integration
- No management protocols.
### Low cost
- Simple and inexpensive.

## Managed switch
### VLAN support
- 802.1Q trunking.
### Traffic prioritization
- Prioritizes voice or critical traffic.
### Redundancy support
- Maintains uptime on failure.
### Port mirroring
- Packet capture for analysis.
### External management
- Managed via SNMP.

## Access points
### Not a wireless router
- Only bridges, doesn’t route.
### Bridge function
- Extends wired to wireless network.   
- Forwards based on MAC addresses.

## Patch panels
### Combine punch-down blocks and RJ-45 connectors.
### Permanent runs
- Desk cables punched down once.
### Flexible switching
- Patch to switch easily without tools.

## Firewalls
### Traffic filtering
- Filters by port (Layer 4) or application.
### Encryption
- Protects traffic between sites.
### Proxy
- Intercepts and controls communication.
### Layer 3 device
- Often positioned at network edge.

## Power over Ethernet

### Power via Ethernet cable
- Network and power on one line.
- Used for phones, cameras, APs.
### Power sources
- Endspans (in-switch) or midspans (injectors).

## PoE switch
### Supplies power
- Marked ports for PoE capability.

## PoE, PoE+, PoE++
### PoE
- 15.4 W, 350 mA.
### PoE+
- 25.5 W, 600 mA.
### PoE++
- 51 W (Type 3), 71.3 W (Type 4).
- Supports 10GBASE-T.
### Compatibility
- PoE+ can’t power PoE++ devices.

## Cable modem
### Broadband over cable
- Uses multiple frequencies.
- DOCSIS standard.
- Up to 1 Gbps.
- Supports data, voice, video.

## DSL modem
### DSL (Digital Subscriber Line)
- Uses phone lines.
- Asymmetric speeds.
- Max ~3000 m from CO.

## ONT
### Optical Network Terminal
- Fiber-to-premises link.
### Function
- Connects ISP fiber to customer copper.
- Acts as demarcation point.
### Responsibility
- ISP on one side, customer on the other.

## Network Interface Card (NIC)
### Core network component
- Every device has one.
- Ethernet, WAN, or wireless type.
### Built-in or add-on
- Integrated or expansion card.
### Unique hardware ID
- MAC address.
