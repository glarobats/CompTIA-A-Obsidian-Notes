## Network services
#### [[2.11 - Common Ports#DNS - Domain Name system|DNS]] server
1. Domain Name system
	- Convert names to IP addresses
	- And vice versa
2. Distributed naming system
	- The load is balanced across many different servers
3. Usually managed by the ISP or enterprise IT department
	- A critical resource
---
#### [[2.11 - Common Ports#DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration protocol|DHCP]] server 
1. Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
	- Automatic [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#IP - Internet Protocol|IP]] address configuration
2. Very common service 
	- Available on most home routers
3. Enterprise [[2.11 - Common Ports#DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration protocol|DHCP]] will be redundant
	- Usually running on central severs
---
#### File share
1. Centralized storage of documents, spreadsheets, videos, pictures and any other files
	- A fileshare
2. Standard system of file management 
	- SMB (Server Message Block), AFP (Apple Filling Protocol), etc.
3. The front-end hides the protocol 
	- Copy, delete, rename, etc.
---
#### Print server
1. Connect a printer to the network
	- Provide printing services for all network devices
2. May be software in a computer
	- Computer is connected to the printer
3. May be built-in to the printer
	- Network adapter and software
4. Uses standard printing protocols
	- SMB (Server Message Block), IPP (Internet Printing Protocol), LDP (Line Printer Daemon)
---
#### Mail server
1. Store your incoming mail
	- Send your outgoing mail
2. Usually managed by the ISP or the enterprise IT department 
	- A complex set of requirements
3. Usually one of the most important services
	- 24 x 7 support
---
#### Syslog
1. Standard for message logging 
	- Diverse systems, consolidate log
2. Usually a central logging receiver
	- Integrated into a SIEM
	- Security Information and Event Manager
	- Takes A LOT of disk space
---
#### Web server
1. Respond to browser requests 
	- Using standard browsing protocols - [[2.11 - Common Ports#HTTP and HTTPS|HTTP / HTTPS]]
	- Pages are build with HTML, HTML5
2. Web pages are stored on the server
	- Downloaded to the browser
	- Static pages or build dynamically in reap-time
--- 
#### Authentication server
1. Authentication, authorization and accounting (AAA) server
	- The login server
2. Login authentication to recourses 
	- Centralized management
3. Almost always an enterprise service 
	- Not required on a home network 
4. Uses:
	- Stores and manages user credentials (username/password, certificates, keys, tokens).
    - Validates login attempts against those credentials.
    - Issues proof of identity (session token, ticket, assertion) if authentication succeeds.
    - Denies access if it fails.
5. Usually a set of redundant servers
	- Always available
	- Extremely important service
---
#### Database servers
1. Database table storage
	- Save information in columns and rows
	- Similar to a spreadsheet 
2. Relational Database
	- Link tables together
	- These links are relationships
	- Flexible an fast
3. SQL (Structured Query Language)
	- Access data using a standard language
	- Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, etc.
---
#### NTP servers
1. The time of day is more important than you may think
	- Network Time Protocol 
	- Encryption, logins, backups, log timestamps
	- Everything needs to work from the same clock
2. NTP server
	- Responds to time requests from NTP clients
3. NTP client 
	- Requests time updates from NTP server
	- Daily synchronization is common 
---
#### Spam gateways
1. Unsolicited email
	- Stop it at the gateway before it reaches the user
	- On-site or cloud based
---
#### All-in-one security appliance 
1. Next-generation firewall, UTM (Unified Management) / Web security gateway
2. URL filter / Content inspection
3. Malware inspection
4. Span filter 
5. CSU / DSU (Channel Service Unit / Data Service Unit)
6. Router / Switch
7. Firewall 
8. IDS / IPS
9. Bandwidth shaper
10. VPN endpoint
---
#### Load balancers
1. Distribute the load
	- Multiple servers
	- Invisible to the end user
2. Large scale implementations
	- Web server farms, database farms
3. Fault tolerance
	- Server outages have no effect
	- Very fast convergence
---
#### Proxy servers
1. An intermediate server
	- Client makes the request to the proxy
	- The proxy performs the actual request
	- The proxy provides results back to the client
2. Useful  features
	- Access control, caching, URL filtering, content scamming
---
#### SCADA / ICS
1. Supervisory control and Data Acquisition System
	- Large scale, multi-site ICS (Industrial Control Systems)
2. PC managers equipment
	- Power generation, refining, manufacturing equipment
	- Facilities, industrial, energy, logistics 
3. Distributed control systems
	- Real-time information
	- System control 
4. Requires extensive segmentation 
	- No access from the outside
---
#### Legacy and embedded systems
1. Legacy systems
	- Another expression for "really old"
	- May also be "really important"
	- Learning old things can be just as important as learning the new things
2. Embedded systems
	- Purpose-built device
	- Not usual to have direct access to the operating system
	- Alarm system, door security, time card system
---
#### IoT (Internet of Things) devices
