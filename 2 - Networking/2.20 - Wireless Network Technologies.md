#### Wireless Technologies

1. IEEE Standards
	- Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
	- 802.11 committee
	- Everyone follows these standards 
2. Also referenced as a generation
	- 802.11ac is [[1.10 - Laptop Hardware#802.11 Wireless and Bluetooth|WiFi]] 5
	- 802.11ax is [[1.10 - Laptop Hardware#802.11 Wireless and Bluetooth|WiFi]] 6 and [[1.10 - Laptop Hardware#802.11 Wireless and Bluetooth|WiFi]] 6E (extended)
	- 802.11be is [[1.10 - Laptop Hardware#802.11 Wireless and Bluetooth|WiFi]] 7
	- Future versions will increment accordingly

#### [[[[1.10 - Laptop Hardware#802.11 Wireless and Bluetooth|WiFi]] technologies
1. Frequencies
	- 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz and 6 GHz
	- Sometimes a combination
2. Channels 
	- Groups of frequencies, numbered by the IEEE
	- Frequencies are managed by governing entities
	- Using non-overlapping channels would be optimal
3. Bandwidth
	- Amount of frequency in use
	- 20MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz, 160 MHz, etc.
4. 2.4 GHz spectrum has a limited range of frequencies
5. 5 GHz has more channels and 6 even more

#### Bluetooth
1. Remove the wires
	- Headsets
	- Speakers
	- Keyboards / Mice
2. Uses the 2.4 GHz range
	- Unlicensed ISM (Industrial, Scientific and Medical) band 
	- same as 802.11
3. Short range
	- Most consumer devices operate to about 10 meters
	- Can interfere with each other if signals are strong and crowded, but protocols are designed to minimize collisions. 
	- In dense 2.4 GHz environments, you’ll still notice performance drops

#### RFID (Radio-Frequecy Identification)
1. It's everywhere
	- Access badges
	- Inventory / Assembly line tracking
	- Pet / Animal identification
	- Anything that needs to be tracked
2. Radar technology
	- Radio energy transmitted to the tag 
	- RF powers the tag, ID is transmitted back
	- Bidirectional communication
	- Some tag formats can be active / powered
	- Passive RFID tags get powered by harvesting RF energy from the reader’s electromagnetic field, rectifying it, and storing it long enough to energize the chip and modulate a response.
	- Inventory tracking (warehouses, retail)
    - Animal tagging
    - Logistics and supply chain
    - Access control badges
3. NFC (Near Field Communication)
	- Builds on RFID, which is only one-way
	- Subset of RFID
	- Contactless payments (Google Pay, Apple Pay)
    - Transit cards, e-passports
    - Phone-to-phone data sharing
    - Smart locks, ticketing
4. Bootstrap for other wireless
	- NFC helps with [[1.10 - Laptop Hardware#802.11 Wireless and Bluetooth|Bluetooth]] pairing
5. Access token, identity card
	- Short range with encryption support
