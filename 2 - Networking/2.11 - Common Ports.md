URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qGlbfZ44hg
---
#### Port numbers
1. Well-known port numbers
	- Client and server need to match
2. Important for firewall rules
	- Port-based security
3. Make sure you know port number, protocol and how the protocol is used
---
#### FTP - File Transfer protocol
1. [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#TCP - Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] / 20 (active mode data), [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#TCP - Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] / 21 (control)
	- Transfers files between systems
2. Authenticates with a username and password 
	- Some systems use a generic / anonymous login
3. Full-featured functionality
	- List, add, delete, etc.
---
#### SSH
1. Encrypted communication link [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#TCP - Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] / 22
2. Looks and acts the same as Telnet (not used anymore as it doesn't provide encryption)
---
#### Telnet
1. Telecommunication network (Visually and functionally is the same as SSH)
	- [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#TCP - Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] / 23
2. Login to devices remotely
	- Console access
3. In-the-clear communication
	- Not the best choice for production systems
---
#### SMTP
1. SMTP - Simple Mail Transfer protocol
	- Server to server email transfer
	- [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#TCP - Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] / 25
2. Also used to send mail from a device to a mail server
	- Commonly configured on mobile devices and mail
3. Other protocols are used for clients to receive mail
	- IMAP, POP3
---
#### DNS - Domain Name system
1. Converts names to [[2.10 - Introduction to IP|IP]] addresses - [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#UDP - User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] / 53
2. www.google.com = 74.125.68.139
3. These are very critical resources 
	- Usually multiple DNS servers are in production 
---
#### DHCP - Dynamic Host Configuration protocol
1. Automated configuration of [[2.10 - Introduction to IP|IP]] addresses, subnet mask and other options
2. [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#UDP - User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] / 67, [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#UDP - User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] / 68
3. Requires a DHCP server 
	- Server, appliance, integrated into a SOHO router, etc.
4. Dynamic / pooled
	- [[2.10 - Introduction to IP|IP]] addresses are assigned in real-time from a pool
	- Each system is given a lease and must renew at set intervals
5. DHCP reservation
	- Addresses are assigned by MAC address in the DHCP server
	- Manage addresses from one location
---
#### HTTP and HTTPS
1. Hypertext Transfer protocol
	- Communication in the browser
	- And by other applications
2. In the clear or encrypted
	- Supported by nearly all web servers and clients

| Protocol |                                     Port                                      |                Name                |               Description                |
|:--------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|:----------------------------------------:|
|   HTTP   | [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#TCP - Transmission Control Protocol\| TCP]] / 80  |    Hypertext Transfer Protocol     |         Web server communication         |
|  HTTPS   | [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#TCP - Transmission Control Protocol\| TCP]] / 443 | Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure | Web server communication with encryption |

#### POP3 / IMAP
1. Receive emails from an email server
	- Authenticate and transfer 
2. POP3 - Post Office Protocol  version 3
	- [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#TCP - Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] / 110 
	- Basic mail transfer functionality 
	- Downloads emails from the mail server to your device.
	- By default, it _removes_ them from the server after download (though some clients let you keep a copy).
	- Simple, lightweight protocol.
	- Good if you only check email from _one device_.
	- Drawback: If you delete or move an email on one device, it won’t sync with others.
3. IMAP4  - Internet Message Access Protocol version 4
	- [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#TCP - Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] / 123 
	- Includes management of email inbox from multiple clients
	- Emails stay on the server by default.
	- Syncs across all devices (phone, PC, webmail). 
	- You see the same inbox/folders everywhere.
	- Supports advanced features (folders, flags, searching on server).
	- Needs constant server connection, uses more storage/bandwidth.

#### SMB - Server Message Block
1. Protocol used by Microsoft Windows 
	- Older version use NetBIOS over [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#TCP - Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] / [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#TCP and UDP|IP]] (NetBT)
	- [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#UDP - User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] / 137
	- [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#TCP - Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] / 139
	- Newer Versions use 
	- [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#TCP - Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] / 445
	- Lets applications and users read, write, and manage files on a remote server as if they were local.
    - Provides access to shared files, printers, and serial ports over a network.
    - Can also handle inter-process communication (IPC).
    - Also called CIFS (Common Internet File System)
	- When you map a network drive (`\\Server\Share`) in Windows, you’re using SMB.
    - Printing to a network printer through a Windows share also often uses SMB.

#### LDAP / LDAPS
1. LDAP - (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
	- [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#TCP - Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] / 389
	- Store and retrieve user accounts, groups, permissions.
	- used in Microsoft Active Directory
	- Authenticate users against a central database (e.g., login to multiple systems with one account).
	- Store organizational data (departments, devices, email addresses).
2. LDAPS - (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Secure)
	- [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#TCP - Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] / 636
	- **Structure:** Hierarchical (tree-like) database. Example:
```
	dc=example,dc=com
    ├── ou=Users
    │     ├── cn=John Doe
    │     └── cn=Jane Smith
    └── ou=Groups
          ├── cn=Admins
          └── cn=Developers
```

#### RDP - Remote Desktop Protocol
1. A proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that lets you connect to another computer and control its desktop remotely (graphics, keyboard, mouse, audio).
	- [[2.10 - Introduction to IP#TCP - Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] / 3389 
	- Can connect to an entire desktop or just an application
	- Other clients DO exists to connect to other OS's (macOS, Linux, Unix, iPhone, Android and others)
