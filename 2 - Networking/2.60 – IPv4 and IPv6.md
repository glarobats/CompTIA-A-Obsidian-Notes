## IP Addressing

### IPv4 is the primary protocol

- Included in almost all configurations.
    

### IPv6 is now part of all major operating systems

- Backbone of modern internet infrastructure.
    

---

## IPv4 addresses

### Internet Protocol version 4

- OSI layer 3 address.
    
- 32 bits → each byte = 8 bits → max decimal value per byte = 255.
    

### Uniqueness

- Each IPv4 address on the internet is unique.
    
- Example: `1.1.1.1` can communicate with `2.2.2.2`.
    

### Scalability

- Estimated 20+ billion devices on the internet.
    
- IPv4 supports ~4.29 billion addresses → obvious scalability issue.
    

### NAT

- Network Address Translation helps manage limited IPv4 space.

## Private IP ranges

### Purpose

- Properly design and scale large networks.
    
- Private IPs are **not internet-routable**, but can be routed internally.
    
- Use NAT to connect to the internet.
    
- Defined in **RFC 1918**.
    

| IP Address Range              | Number of addresses | Classful description     | Largest CIDR Block (Subnet Mask) | Host ID size |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255     | 16,777,216          | Single Class A           | 10.0.0.0/8 (255.0.0.0)           | 24 bits      |
| 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255   | 1,048,576           | 16 contiguous Class B’s  | 172.16.0.0/12 (255.240.0.0)      | 20 bits      |
| 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 | 65,536              | 256 contiguous Class C’s | 192.168.0.0/16 (255.255.0.0)     | 16 bits      |
## IPv6 addresses

### Internet Protocol version 6

- 128-bit addresses.
    
- DNS is important for resolution.
    
- First 64 bits = network prefix (`/64`).
    
- Last 64 bits = host identifier.

| Address Type                | Range                                                                      | Scope           | Purpose / Notes                                                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Global Unicast**          | `2000::/3 - 3fff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff`                       | Global          | Publicly routable addresses on the internet; equivalent to IPv4 public addresses.                                                                            |
| **Unique Local (ULA)**      | `fc00::/7 - fdff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff` (commonly `fd00::/8`) | Private / Site  | Private, internal networks; not routable on the internet; IPv6 equivalent of IPv4 private addresses (10.x.x.x, 192.168.x.x).                                 |
| **Link-Local**              | `fe80::/10 - febf:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff`                      | Link            | Mandatory on every interface; used for local communication, neighbor discovery, routing protocols; cannot be routed beyond the local link.                   |
| **Multicast**               | `ff00::/8 - ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff`                       | Varies by scope | One-to-many communication. Scope defined in second hex digit: 1=interface, 2=link, 5=site, 8=organization, E=global. Example: `ff02::1` = all nodes on link. |
| **Loopback**                | `::1/128`                                                                  | Node-local      | Loopback address, same host only (like IPv4 127.0.0.1).                                                                                                      |

| **Reserved / Experimental** | `::/8`, other reserved                                                     | Various         | Not currently in use; reserved for future protocols or testing.                                                                                              |
